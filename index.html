                    <li>We informed them that The Vampire Blade was safe from The Emerald Claw, and that we did not have it nor know of it's wherabouts.  We also informed them that Lucian Stellos was in the wind. Whether he was alive or not remains unknown.</li>

                    <li>(Monica only: She had a moment of apprehension towards this act and questioned Merricks intentions. However Lady E. seems to be above board.)</li>
